## Description
Store Maintenance is developed to give shop developers/administrators an easy way to lock out customers, while they maintain their stores.

## Features
 * A custom html page can be defined in the backend, which is displayed to all customers, while the store is in maintenance mode.
 * After logging into the backend as an administrator, the frontend can be used with this account. This way updates and changes to the shop / design can be reviewed and tested in a safe manner.
 * IPs can be white listed from within the backend, so chosen accounts can view the store frontend while in maintenance mode, without having to have administrator access.

## Compatibility
 * Magento >= 1.4
